Second Game in HTML CANVAS. 
I will attempt to make this game in Godot as well. Compare and contrast the two later.

Current idea: 

Open World and 2D Enviroment. Enemies spawn and head towards the player in all arounds. 
The player can interact with castles, portals, or [] blocks / frames to enter new scenes. 
Potential scenes and locations that the player can go into include shops and dungeons.
Within the shop, the player can use skill points (earned from leveling up by fighting mobs and []) for perks as well as purchase weapons and potions with gold earned by killing mobs.

Attack ideas that user can use - 

Potion ideas - health potion, jump potion (quite literally able to jump over the enemies in this 2d world where enemies are mostly on the ground.

Weapon ideas: 

Armour ideas:

(However introduce flying enemy [enemies] as well. 

Skill point perks - increase max health, increase gold found or dropped, increase melee, range, mage damage.
                  - SPECIAL PERKS -- ability to slow down all enemies' game speed to fight harder bosses, etc.

Different types of enemies - slow but strong, fast but weak, archers, mage enemies, flying enemies, ginormous enemies, miniboss

AFK aspect of game - character can AFK in a specific building that they use currency (from killing mobs or leveling up) to purchase. 
                   - allows character to gain xp and skill points while they afk the game, possibly maximum of in real life hour. 
                   - cooldown for 12 in real life hours before they can use the afk house again.


Storyline: 

The user will first have to learn how to navigate throghout the game by getting coins and weapons / items by killing enemies who will come swarm him. 
But as the user progresses in this infinite procedural world, he will find dungeons as his first portal / new scenery teleporation. After he conquers the dungeon, there starts to be hints about how the last user found himself in the same situation, just dropped into this world of constant enemies. But first user dies in the dungeon, and then we see that user's "grave" in the dungeon. 
The user then keeps progressing leveling up until the user interacts with [] and a miniboss shows up and tells the user that he does not belong in this world, then a fight ensures. All the minibosses will have texts that contain anger towards the main character. 

What's the main storyline? 


How do I want the user to play the game / why whould they play the game in the first place?
