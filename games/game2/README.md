game scene that i currently have in mind:

2d world
One main character
tons of generated fighters
cool attacks and effects made for the character's attacks
character can AFK in a specific building that they use currency (from killing mobs or leveling up) to purchase 
character has the option to speed up or slow down game (like BTD) to fight harder mobs
many types of mobs
many types of character attacks: mage, melee, special abilities
character can also jump over enemies with a special boot
skill upgrades, armour upgrades, and weapon upgrades
